# self-cleaning-solar-panel-system
An innovative self-cleaning solar panel system that utilizes Peltier thermoelectric modules for air-to-water condensation, harvesting water to clean the solar panel surface. The system optimizes panel efficiency by removing dust and debris, making solar energy production more sustainable in remote or low-maintenance environments.
# Self-Cleaning Solar Panel with Air-to-Water Condensation System

This project implements a **self-cleaning solar panel system** that uses **Peltier thermoelectric modules** to condense water from the air, which is then used to clean the panel surface. Itâ€™s designed for use in areas where manual cleaning and water supply are difficult.

## Features:
- Automated cleaning system triggered by water condensation.
- Water harvested using Peltier thermoelectric modules.
- Optimized airflow with fans and water misting system for panel cleaning.
- Low maintenance with intelligent control system.

## Hardware Used:
- **Peltier Modules**: For air-to-water condensation.
- **Fans**: To enhance airflow over the cold surface.
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino or Raspberry Pi for system control.
- **Water Tank**: Stores the condensed water.
- **Humidity & Temperature Sensors**: To monitor environmental conditions.
- **Mist Nozzles**: For cleaning the panels.

## How to Set Up:
### Requirements:
1. **Hardware**: A microcontroller (Arduino/Raspberry Pi), Peltier modules, fans, misting system, humidity and temperature sensors.
2. **Software**: Python 3.x, Adafruit libraries for sensors, and control logic.

### Installation Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/self-cleaning-solar-panel.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd self-cleaning-solar-panel
    ```

3. Install necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Connect all hardware components (refer to hardware schematic diagram).
5. Run the main control script:
    ```bash
    python code/main.py
    ```

### Testing:
- The system will automatically detect humidity levels and initiate cleaning cycles when sufficient condensation is generated.
- You can monitor system performance via serial outputs or connect the system to a cloud dashboard for remote monitoring.
